# Quick Reference Guides to CHIPSEC
Currently only a single guide available, aimed at Enterprise System Administrators, SRE, OPSdev, DFIR and Blue Teams - all defensive.

* As .fodt for your suggested improvements.
* As .pdf designed for printing on 8.5x11 inch paper, and laid out as a tri-fold.

If you see us in person, we'll probably have a paper copy on hand and be happy to give it to you, along with BadBIOS stickers!
